# Permissions Extras Plugin

I like Mark Story's Acl Extras. 

I want to make it convenient to reset the acos_aros table in a single command.

So I made two decisions:

a) I observed RBAC - role-based authorization control. Also known as Group only ACL in cakephp book

b) I created this plugin which has that single command.
